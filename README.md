# covid19

### **COVID-19 Project**

**Objective:**
The goals of this project is to produce a series of interactive graphs detailing vaccination rates and the overall impact of Covid-19 on our community. Data on total positive cases and vaccination by race, zip code, age and school will be used to propose a strategy to increase vaccination rates in the county. 

**Covid-19 Data:**
Data for the project are updated daily and can be found at this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gCgq2lhkdYOwvTwTlhQZyyB-xayzC4gt4264IK6uBGc/edit?usp=sharing  

**Tasks for the group**

Most of the work has been done over the summer, and the graphs and summit presentation can be viewed at this link (slides 98-106): https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11j-OT4toAdBen3me-3KjyKPAnp9U0j9ff0Ppb2qglKY/edit?usp=sharing. 

The following tasks need to be completed.

1) Interactive graphs: All the graphs in the presentation need to be updated and code written so to produce a new set of interactive graphs in Plotly that can be put on the YSA website.

2) Design a Covid Map: Come up with an index to show risk of covid by zip code and then plot it on a Plotly map.
